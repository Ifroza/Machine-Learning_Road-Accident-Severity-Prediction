# Road Accident Severity Prediction using Machine Learning 
## Introduction
The road accident severity prediction aims to develop a robust predictive model that can accurately assess the severity of road accidents. By analyzing various features such as Driving_experience, Area_accident_occured, Weather_conditions, and Number_of_casualties, etc. the project seeks to anticipate the potential severity of accidents.
## Problem Statement
The project addresses the significant issue of road accidents and their associated consequences, including fatalities. By developing a predictive model for road accident severity, the project aims to provide stakeholders with valuable insights to proactively mitigate the impact of accidents and improve road safety measures. The ultimate goal is to provide valuable insights to stakeholders such as law enforcement agencies, transportation authorities, and emergency responders, enabling them to allocate resources more effectively, implement preventive measures, and improve overall road safety.
## Motivation
The motivation stems from the urgent need to enhance road safety and reduce the human and economic toll of road accidents. With road accidents posing a continuous threat to public safety worldwide, there's a pressing need for proactive measures to address this issue. By leveraging machine learning models and techniques to predict accident severity, the project aims to empower stakeholders with the tools and information needed to prevent accidents, optimize emergency response efforts, and ultimately save lives.
## Features
1) Utilized available data for road accidents previously happened
2) Applied machine learning techniques for accident severity prediction
3) Provides accurate results with high precision and recall scores
4) Contributes to informed decision-making for this sector
## Getting Started
* Clone this repository.
* Add data file path to code 3rd cell.
* Run the main script to train and evaluate the prediction model.
## Models used
1)  Naive Bayes:
* Employs Bayes' theorem to calculate probabilities of class memberships.
* Assumes conditional independence among input features to simplify computations.
* This probabilistic model offers swift and reliable predictions even with limited data.

2) Decision Tree:
* Construcs a tree-like structure by recursively partitioning the data.
* Makes predictions based on the majority class within each partition.
* This hierarchical approach discerns complex decision boundaries efficiently.

3) KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):
* Utilizes neighboring data points to classify or predict outcomes.
* Determines the majority class among the nearest neighbors to make predictions.
* This proximity-based method leverages local patterns for accurate predictions.

4) Random Forest:
* Generates a multitude of decision trees, each offering its unique viewpoint.
* Aggregates forecasts from all trees and opts for the most frequent prediction.
* This ensemble technique mitigates individual shortcomings and furnishes a resilient forecast.

5) SVM (Support Vector Machine):
* Identifies the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes.
* Maximizes the margin between classes to enhance generalization.
* This margin-focused technique effectively handles high-dimensional data and nonlinear boundaries.

6) MLP (Multilayer Perceptron):
* Constructs a network of interconnected nodes organized in layers.
* Utilizes forward propagation to compute predictions and backpropagation to adjust model parameters.
* This deep learning architecture excels at capturing intricate patterns in data.
## Results
The project has developed several machine learning models for predicting road accident severity. The models include Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, & MLP. All of the models' performances have been evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, providing insights into their predictive capabilities.
